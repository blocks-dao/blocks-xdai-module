# BLOCKS xDAI Module

This application interacts with the xDAI OmbiBridge to port BLOCKS between networks. You can migrate BLOCKS from ETH to xDAI and back again. 

# Use Cases for BLOCKS on xDAI

- Fast and extremely low-cost BLOCKS transactions for P2P
- BLOCKS compatibility with DeFi applications on xDAI

## Project Notes:
- Project interacts with Ethereum mainnet and xDAI mainnet
- Metamask is used as the provider to sign transactions
- Bridging back to ETH from xDAI requires a manual execution on the [ABM Live Monitoring Tool](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/about-tokenbridge/components/amb-live-monitoring-application)
